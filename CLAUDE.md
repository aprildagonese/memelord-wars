# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a Python project with a virtual environment setup. The project uses Python 3.13.5 with a virtual environment located in `venv/`.

## Development Environment Setup

1. **Virtual Environment**: The project uses a Python virtual environment located in `venv/`
   - Activate: `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
   - Deactivate: `deactivate`

2. **Python Version**: Python 3.13.5 (managed via asdf)

## Common Commands

Since this is a new/minimal Python project, standard Python development commands would apply:

- **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if requirements.txt exists)
- **Run Python scripts**: `python <script_name>.py`
- **Install packages**: `pip install <package_name>`
- **Generate requirements**: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## Development Notes

- This appears to be a fresh Python project with only a virtual environment set up
- No specific build tools, testing frameworks, or linting tools are currently configured
- The project structure is minimal and would need to be expanded based on project requirements
- Virtual environment should be activated before running any Python commands

## Architecture

The project is currently in its initial state with only the virtual environment configured. The architecture will need to be established as the project develops.
